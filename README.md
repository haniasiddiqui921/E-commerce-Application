🔄 How It Works

Products are fetched from an API using fetch().

When a product is clicked, its ID is stored in localStorage.

The Detail page retrieves that ID and fetches the selected product data.

Filter functionality allows users to sort products.

Fully responsive layout using CSS media queries.
